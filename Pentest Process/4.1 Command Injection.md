#### Web Application Exploits

- **Command Line Injection**:
  - **Overview**: Command line injection is a vulnerability where an attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the host operating system via a vulnerable application. It typically occurs when a web application passes unsafe user-supplied data (forms, cookies, HTTP headers, etc.) to system shells.
  - **Detection Techniques**: Detection involves testing input fields and other data submission points for improper input validation. Tools like Burp Suite or manual testing using special characters that can trigger command line execution are commonly used.
  - **Exploitation Methods**: Exploitation is achieved by inserting or injecting commands into the input fields. This may involve crafting payloads that the application executes on the server's operating system. Tools like Metasploit can be used to automate this process.
  - **Preventive Measures**: Prevention includes proper input validation, use of parameterized queries, and limiting web application privileges on the server. Regularly updating and patching software also reduces the risk.
