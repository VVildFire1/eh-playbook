#### Web Application Exploits
- **Command Line Injection**:
  - **Overview**: Command line injection is a vulnerability where an attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the host operating system via a vulnerable application. It typically occurs when a web application passes unsafe user-supplied data (forms, cookies, HTTP headers, etc.) to system shells.
  - **Detection Techniques**: Detection involves testing input fields and other data submission points for improper input validation. Tools like Burp Suite or manual testing using special characters that can trigger command line execution are commonly used.
  - **Exploitation Methods**: Exploitation is achieved by inserting or injecting commands into the input fields. This may involve crafting payloads that the application executes on the server's operating system. Tools like Metasploit can be used to automate this process.
  - **Preventive Measures**: Prevention includes proper input validation, use of parameterized queries, and limiting web application privileges on the server. Regularly updating and patching software also reduces the risk.

#### Other Access Techniques
- As you learn more techniques for gaining access, such as SQL injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), or exploiting buffer overflows, add them here with similar details.

#### Ethical Considerations
- Emphasize the importance of ethical hacking: these techniques should only be used for lawful, authorized testing. Always obtain explicit permission before testing.

#### Resources
- Include links to resources or tutorials for in-depth understanding and practice of each technique.

#### Conclusion
- Highlight the importance of responsible use of these techniques in ethical hacking and penetration testing. Remind readers that the goal is to improve security, not to exploit it for unauthorized purposes.
