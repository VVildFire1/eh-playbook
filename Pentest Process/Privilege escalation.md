### Introduction to Privilege Escalation

Privilege Escalation is a critical concept in cybersecurity, where an attacker gains higher-level access, often going from a normal user to an administrative level. This process is key for attackers to gain more control over a system or network, allowing them to access restricted areas and sensitive data. Understanding privilege escalation is essential for both offensive and defensive cybersecurity practices.

- **Common Techniques**:
  - Exploiting system vulnerabilities, weak passwords, misconfigurations, and social engineering tactics.

- **Tools**:
  - Specialized software and scripts used to identify and exploit vulnerabilities in systems for elevating privileges.

ways you can become root
Check for SUID's; can also check the /opt directory; look for newer files

```shell
find / -perm -u=s -type f 2>/dev/null | xargs ls -l
```

Check for SUID's on older kernals

```shell
find / -perm -4000 -type f 2>/dev/null | xargs ls -l
```
