#### Using dirb to Scan 10.10.1.3:80 (open web site found on target)

- **Basic Syntax of dirb**:
  - The command structure is `dirb <URL> <WORDLIST>`.
  - `<URL>`: The URL or IP address of the target.
  - `<WORDLIST>`: The path to the wordlist file for directory or file discovery.

- **Scanning Command**:
  ```bash
  dirb http://10.10.1.3:80 /usr/share/dirb/wordlists/common.txt
  ```
  - This command directs `dirb` to scan the website at `10.10.1.3` on port `80` using a common wordlist.

- **Interpreting Results**:
  - The output includes a list of discovered directories and files with their respective status codes (like accessible, forbidden, not found, etc.).

- **Additional Options**:
  - `-X`: Append file extensions to each request (e.g., `.php`, `.html`).
  - `-r`: Avoid recursive scanning of subdirectories.
  - `-o`: Output results to a specified file.

- **Post-Scan Analysis**:
  - Review the results to identify interesting or sensitive directories/files.
  - Further investigate each finding for additional information or vulnerabilities.
