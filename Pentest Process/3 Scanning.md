### From outside the Target network you need to find what ports are open. This is also where i start to set up origination for my work and will make a folder some where on my attacker Machine.

```bash
Nano ~/Desktop/pentest/scope
```

in this scope file i will put the external/public IP/hostname that I will be attacking

```scope
10.10.1.3
```

from here i will run a fast scan with Nmap

```bash
sudo nmap -iL scope -F -oN fast_scan (if no response try adding -Pn)
```

## The command `sudo nmap -iL scope -F -oN fast_scan` performs a network scan using Nmap with the following options:

1. `sudo`: 
   - Runs the command with superuser privileges, ensuring sufficient permissions for network scanning.

2. `nmap`:
   - Nmap (Network Mapper) is used for network discovery and security auditing.

3. `-iL scope`:
   - Instructs Nmap to read the list of target hosts from a file named `scope`, containing IP addresses or hostnames to scan.

4. `-F`:
   - Specifies a fast scan, limiting the scan to the most commonly used ports for quicker results.

5. `-oN fast_scan`:
   - Outputs the scan results in a human-readable format to a file named `fast_scan`, detailing the status of each scanned port.

This command is useful for quickly identifying open ports on the targets listed in the `scope` file.

## If I need a larger scan I will do the following

```bash
sudo nmap -iL scope -sV -oN service_scan
```

## The command `sudo nmap -iL scope -sV -oN service_scan` is an Nmap command used for network scanning. Let's break down what is new to this command:


1. `-sV`:
    
    - This option enables version detection. It tells Nmap to not only find out what services are running on open ports but also to determine the version of those services. This is more informative than a simple port scan as it can identify specific versions of software, which can be useful for finding vulnerabilities known to exist in certain versions.


## full_scan

```bash
sudo nmap -iL scope -A -Pn -p- -oN full_scan
```




# At this point i am hoping to find some open ports
IE. port 80 being a HTML port I would open my browser and see what comes up

at this point  if 80 is open I will start looking over the webpage to see what i can find maybe a web app I can explot to get in 

you can also Go back to nmap and look at service versions and do a quick search for any known exploits specifically google for 'service_version ### (exploit/poc/github/rce/code execution/bypass)'
