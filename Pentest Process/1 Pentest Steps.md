#### Penetration Testing Process

- **Scoping (Client-Provided Information)**:
  - Information provided in the Scope of Work (SoW), typically a list of hostnames/IPs.

- **Reconnaissance (Passive and Active, OSINT & Scanning)**:
  - **Passive Reconnaissance**:
    - Utilizing Google, OSINT, and HUMINT to gather information without directly interacting with the target.
  - **Active Reconnaissance**:
	  - # [Scanning](3%20Scanning.md)
	    - Verifying if the machine is online and discovering other machines.
	    - Finding open ports and vulnerable services/webpages.
    - Tools and Techniques:
      - [PingSweep](3.2%20Ping%20Sweep.md)
        - `-sn/for loop one-liner/arp -a`: Used to identify other machines on the network.
      - **NMap Scans**:
        - `Fast`, `Service`, and `All` scans to find open ports on targets.
      - **Vulnerability Assessment**:
        - Using Openvas, Nessus, etc., to identify exploitable vulnerabilities.

- **Exploitation**:
	- # [Gaining Access](4%20Gaining%20Access.md)
	  - Finding vulnerabilities through service enumeration or creating/finding zero-day exploits.
	  - Searching for exploit Proof of Concept (PoC) code/payload via Google or Searchsploit.
	  - [Command Injection](4.1%20Command%20Injection.md)
	  - Getting a [Reverse Shell](Reverse%20Shell%20and%20Upgrades.md) and upgrading it.
	  - Note: Be cautious with unstable exploits!

- **Post-Exploitation**:
  - **Privilege Escalation (Priv Esc)**:
    - Achieving root access, using tools like linpeas/winpeas.
    - Transfer tools to the target via a Python web server or SMB.
  - **Pivoting**:
    - Conducting a ping sweep and checking the ARP cache.
    - Using proxychains from Kali for further exploration.
  - **Persistence**:
    - Establishing a method for continuous reverse shell access, especially important with unstable exploits.
    - Create a cron job (`sudo crontab -e`) to send a reverse shell at regular intervals.
  - **Data Exfiltration (Data Exfil)**: find your loot 
    - Looking for sensitive data like hard-coded passwords, SSH/rsa keys, hashed passwords in `/etc/shadow`, CTF flags, and password reuse opportunities.
