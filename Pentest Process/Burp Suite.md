#### Testing Command Injection with Burp Suite

Burp Suite is a powerful tool used in web application security testing. One of its uses is to test for command injection vulnerabilities. This guide provides a step-by-step approach to using Burp Suite for such testing.

#### Step 1: Setting Up Burp Suite

- **Install and Launch Burp Suite**:
  - Ensure Burp Suite is properly installed on your system.
  - Launch Burp Suite and start a new project (temporary or permanent based on your requirement).

- **Configure Browser to Use Burp Suite's Proxy**:
  - Open your preferred web browser.
  - Navigate to the browser's network or proxy settings.
  - Set the proxy to route traffic through Burp Suite. Typically, this involves setting the HTTP proxy to `127.0.0.1` (localhost) with port `8080`, which is the default listening port for Burp Suite.
  - Save these settings to route your browser traffic through Burp Suite for interception and analysis.

- **Verify Proxy Connection**:
   - In your browser, try accessing any website. You should see the HTTP request appear in the Burp Suite's `Proxy` > `Intercept` tab, indicating that the browser's traffic is being correctly routed through Burp Suite.

- **Step 2: Intercepting Requests**
  - Navigate to the target web application in your browser.
   - Perform actions on the web application that send requests to the server (like submitting a form).

- **Step 3: Identifying Injection Points**
  - In the intercepted requests, identify potential injection points. These are usually input fields or URL parameters where user-supplied data is sent to the server.

- **Step 4: Manipulating Parameters**
  - Modify the parameters by inserting typical command injection payloads. Examples include appending `|`, `&&`, or `;` followed by a recognizable command like `ping`.
  - For instance, if a parameter value is `param1=value`, change it to `param1=value|ping -c 1 127.0.0.1`.

- **Step 5: Analyzing Responses**
  - Forward the modified request and observe the application's response.
  - Look for indications that your command was executed, such as unusual delays (suggestive of the `ping` command) or specific command outputs in the response.

- **Step 6: Using Burp Suite's Intruder**
  - Burp Suite's `Intruder` can automate testing for command injection.
  - Set up an attack targeting the suspected injection point, using a list of common command injection payloads.
  - Analyze the responses for signs of successful command execution.

- **Step 7: Confirming and Reporting**
  - Once a potential vulnerability is identified, confirm it by executing a benign command and observing its effect.
  - Document the findings with detailed request and response data for reporting.
