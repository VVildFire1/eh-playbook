### Gaining Access

#### Introduction
- Gaining access involves exploiting vulnerabilities in systems or applications to gain unauthorized access. This phase is critical in penetration testing as it demonstrates the impact of a vulnerability.


### Methods to Gain Access

1. **([Command Injection](./4.1 Command Injection.md)**: Exploiting insecure processing of external input in applications to execute arbitrary commands on the host system.

2. **SQL Injection**: Injecting malicious SQL queries into input fields to manipulate or gain access to a database.

3. **Exploiting Software Vulnerabilities**: Leveraging known or unknown vulnerabilities in software, including operating systems, web applications, and network services.

4. **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**: Injecting malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users to bypass access controls.

5. **Buffer Overflow Attacks**: Exploiting programs by overloading their buffer memory to execute arbitrary code or disrupt services.

6. **Phishing Attacks**: Deceiving users into providing sensitive information like usernames and passwords.

7. **Social Engineering**: Manipulating individuals into breaking normal security procedures to gain unauthorized access.

8. **Password Attacks**: Using techniques like brute force, dictionary attacks, or credential stuffing to crack or guess passwords.

9. **Session Hijacking and Token Theft**: Intercepting or stealing session tokens to impersonate a legitimate user on a web application.

10. **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks**: Intercepting and altering communication between two parties to gain unauthorized access or information.

11. **Exploiting Misconfigurations**: Taking advantage of insecure default configurations, incomplete setups, or other oversight in system configurations.

12. **Physical Access Attacks**: Gaining direct physical access to a computer or network to bypass security controls.

13. **Wireless Network Attacks**: Exploiting vulnerabilities in wireless networking protocols (like WEP, WPA, WPA2).

14. **Zero-Day Exploits**: Exploiting vulnerabilities that are unknown to the software vendor or for which no patch has yet been released.

15. **Drive-by Downloads**: Unintentionally downloading malicious code just by visiting a compromised website, leading to system infection.

16. **Side-Channel Attacks**: Exploiting physical implementations of a system to gain indirect information about data or cryptographic keys.
