# From outside the Target network you need to find what ports are open. This is also where i start to set up origination for my work and will make a folder some where on my attacker Machine.

```bash
Nano ~/Desktop/pentest/scope
```

in this scope file i will put the external/public IP/hostname that I will be attacking

```scope
10.10.1.3
```

from here i will run a fast scan with Nmap

```bash
sudo nmap -iL scope -F -oN fast_scan (if no response try adding -Pn)
```

if i need a larger scan i will do the following

```bash
sudo nmap -iL scope -sV -oN service_scan
```

```bash
sudo nmap -iL scope -A -Pn -p- -oN full_scan
```

at this point i am hoping to find some open ports
IE. port 80 being a HTML port I would open my browser and see what comes up

at this point  if 80 is open I will start looking over the webpage to see what i can find maybe a web app I can explot to get in 

you can also Go back to nmap and look at service versions and do a quick search for any known exploits specifically google for 'service_version ### (exploit/poc/github/rce/code execution/bypass)'
